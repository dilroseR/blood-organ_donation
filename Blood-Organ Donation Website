Blood-Organ donation is one of the most significant contributions that a person can make towards society.
Blood-Organ Donation website manages blood and organ donation across India. 
This site aims to build a possible connection between organ donors and transplant patients.
This website is a combination of front-end and back-end fundamentals made for a noble and great cause.
The front-end is designed with the help of Bootstrap, HTML, CSS while the back-end is built using MySQL and PHP.
This project contains the user and the admin side.
The user and the donor can register through the registration forms available on the website, both the registrations for the donors and the patients are absolutely free.
The admin's role is to connect the potential donor to its user.
The user can either be a donor or a transplant patient.
The potential donors can register through the website proir to their donation in case of blood, while for organ donation the donors can register and the patients can login/register to the site and see the possible matches, i.e the potential donors.
The admin then contacts the potential donor, confirms their donation and then contacts the patient who is in dire need of the donation for blood/organ.
